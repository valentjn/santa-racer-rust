# Santa Racer (Rust Port)

Santa Racer is an open-source clone of “Nikolaus Express 2000,” a Christmas-themed advergame/screensaver by German advertising agency Anders und Seim Neue Medien AG. The goal is to steer Santa's sleigh over the roofs of a snowy village and to drop presents into chimneys to score points.

The source code has been written entirely from scratch and is placed under MPL-2.0.

Before running Santa Racer, the assets must be extracted from the original game (or created from scratch). The original game can only be distributed with the setup EXE as a whole. According to the message box that opens when running the EXE, non-commercial redistribution is permitted. However, extracting the assets may be illegal in your jurisdiction (distributing them definitely is). Do this at your own risk!
